\section{[R-0] Everyone <3 Fan Mail}

	This series of challenges were made slightly more tedious than necessary, because unfortunately there was a real company
	called \enquote{LightSpeed} that diluted the search results.

	The main objective of this challenge was to find the email of the site administrator for \url{www.lightspeedcorp.global}, and
	send him an email.

	\subsection{Solution}

		In theory, all we would have needed to do was perform a WHOIS lookup on the domain to find the email address. Simple,
		right?

		Nope.

		Depending on which WHOIS search engine is used, certain bits of information about the registrant can be missing if the
		domain was registered with WHOISGuard, which hides certain identifiable information from WHOIS lookups.

			\caption{All the information is visible if WHOISGuard is ignored}
		\end{figure}

		\pagebreak
		However, it turns out that the guard isn't perfect, and all we had to do was find a WHOIS search engine that ignores the
		guard. After some digging, we found one, exposing all the juicy details of the registrant.

		After getting the email address, we just had to send an email, and we were replied with the flag.

\section{[R-1] Travel to the Past}

	The challenge heavily hinted that we would need a way to look at an older version of the website to find the flag, and that's exactly
	what we did.

	\subsection{Solution}

		There was a single snapshot of the website on the Wayback Machine\footnote{\url{https://archive.org/web/}} on the 20\sps{th} of May,
		and browsing that snapshot revealed the flag on the homepage of a blog:

		\begin{figure}[!htbp]\centering
			\includegraphics[width=110mm]{figures/osintred/r1.png} \vspace{5mm}
			\caption{The flag is clearly visible}

\section{[R-2] I'm Sho Done With This}

	\subsection{Solution}

		The hint was in the question title itself --- turns out that there is a search engine called \enquote{ShoDan}
		\footnote{\url{https://www.shodan.io}}, which claims to be the world's first search engine for internet connected devices.

		Sure enough, searching for our favourite company \enquote{lightspeedcorp} yielded the following results:

		\begin{figure}[!htbp]\centering
			\includegraphics[width=150mm]{figures/osintred/r2.png} \vspace{5mm}
			\caption{The flag is reversed, for some reason}
		\end{figure}

		A trivial string-reverse later, the flag is obtained.

\section{[R-3-1] Have They Been Pwned?}

	The challenge description wasn't very helpful here...

	\subsection{Solution}
		This question was quite a challenge. The only hint from the question is that there has been a leak from LightSpeedCorp.
		With the Google search results being filled with the real life LightSpeed company, it was impossible to find relevant
		results.

		The breakthrough came when we thought about where would leaks get posted --- somewhere that would be anonymous but
		easy to access. After brainstorming and searching through multiple sites, we finally found the answer:
		Pastebin\footnote{\url{https://pastebin.com}}. Searching for "LightSpeedCorp" in Pastebin yielded this page:

		\begin{figure}[!htbp]\centering
			\includegraphics[width=130mm]{figures/osintred/r31.png} \vspace{5mm}
			\caption{Oh, numbers again...}
		\end{figure}

		Interpreting the digits as hexdecimal and turning them into ASCII gives us our flag.

\section{[R-4-1] Where I Get All My Memes From}

	Memes sound like fun!

	\subsection{Solution}

		With the name of our administrator obtained (Luther Torvalds), we just had to search him up on Twitter to reveal
		his profile, and the flag:

\section{[R-4-1-2] Don't Be A Git}

	Git? Torvalds? Hmm...

	\subsection{Solution}

		Following the followers (hmm) of Luther, we found Bobby Hashlinger, who posted serveral GitHub links on his
		Twitter, one of which was
		\ttt{d4rkspeedcorp-framework}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/sjang3141592653/d4rkspeedcorp-framework}}.

		Upon further inspection, the flag (or something like it) was found in the branch \ttt{super-new-feature}, in
		the latest commit:

		\begin{figure}[!htbp]\centering
			\includegraphics[width=130mm]{figures/osintred/r412.png} \vspace{5mm}
			\caption{I would paste it directly, but unicode...}
		\end{figure}

		The more challenging part was to find the correct tool to make the text upright again... after some searching,
		we found it\footnote{\url{https://www.toolpond.com/tool/text-flipper}}, and the flag.
